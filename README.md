#Introduction to Visualizing Data

Today we will cover the basics on how to visualize data in a meaningful manner.  
We will mostly be working with the matplotlib python library.  

**Before class**
1.  Watch the following documentary regarding Crime in the city of Chicago.  `http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/interrupters/#the-interrupters-(graphic-language)`

2. Please read the following pages from matplotlib Plotting CookBook.  This should take you about 30min.
